# ColorFlipper

Personal Angular 8+ made by Raul Gonzalez. It's a simple app that contains some Angular routing and use of service coupled with components to switch colors and having them persist through route changes.

## Description

Color Flipper randomly selects a color from a json in the project which contains all colors with name i.e. Red, Blue, Teal, Turquoise...
Default or Home view is a name or text based view. You can toggle RGB or Hex view using the Navigation bar on top where the colors will persist.
You can randomly select a new color while in RGB or Hex view, but the colors will be from the same json that contains colors with names.
